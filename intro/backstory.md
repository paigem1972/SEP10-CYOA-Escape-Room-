# Introduction 

The harsh cold of your room is what wakes you up from your dreamless sleep. As you reach for your blanket you can tell through your hazy vision that this is not your room. Despite being disoriented you rise from your bed and look around. From what you can tell you are in a hospital, but you don't recall any reason why you could possibly be here. You ponder what your next steps should be. Only then do you realize that your door is barricaded, curiosity rushes through you, but you also can't deny the thought of going back to bed in your surprisingly comfortable bed.

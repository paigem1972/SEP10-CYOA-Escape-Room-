# SEP10-CYOA-Escape-Room-
## Escape Room 

The purpose of creating this repository was to practice collaboration and work on our coding skills. In this repo you will be challenged to escape a hospital you woke up in while avoiding all threats. My partners and I wanted to put a bit of a horror twist on our project, so this isn't a conventional escape room. The player, you, will be in a life or death situation instead of a controlled environment. **_Trigger warnings include: Getting shot, zombies, death, starvation, and getting eaten by the zombies._** Of course these scenes are not detailed, but these are still important to mention since your mental health is important to us. If this wasn't what you were looking for then we hope you have luck finding something that you enjoy!
